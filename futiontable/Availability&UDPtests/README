Folder Name : Buffer_Throughput
Description : 
The folder contains the scripts and stored procedures which can be used to find the following:
- Buffer sizes : median, mean, max,min,std Dev.
- Drain sizes : median, mean, max,min,std Dev.
- UDP Throughput : median, mean, max,min,std Dev. of UDP throughputs in both directions, ie uplink and downlink

Availability

Folder Name: Availability
Descrition:
Contains scripts to find the overall and Daily availabilites. There are three files in the folder "AvailabilityRange.txt", "percentile_availability.sql" and "FindAvailability.sh".

FindAvailability.sh : 
It contains 6 queries. First three queries give the total connected time, dongle error time and signal unavailability time. With this we can calculate the overall availability of a node. The first query also gives the total number of days where there was a some availability. To calculate the availability follow the formula:
	Availability = Total Connected Time / (NoofDaysof Connected time * 86400 - MAX(Dongleerrotime,NoSignalTime)
	Query 4 gives the daily availability
	Query 5 gives the median availability
	Query 6 gives the 90 percentile availability
	Query 5 and 6 uses the "percentile_availability" stored procedure.
		Command : bash FindAvailability.sh
		Output  : Calulates and produces the following outputs:
			1 - Total connection time and the number of days with some connection (File:"AvailabilityData")
			2 - Dongle Error Time - the time when some error occured with the dongle (File:"AvailabilityData")
			3 - No Signal Availability time - The time when either the system was down or signal was unavailable due to system, dongle or signal problem (File:"AvailabilityData")
			Using the first 3 we can find the Overall Availability for the given duration as per the formula mentioned above.
			4 - Daily Average availability (File : "DailyAvailability")
			5 - Midian Availability (File : "medianAvailability")
			6 - Ninety Percentile Availability (File : "ninetyAvailability")
		These values are written into respective files as mentioned in the brackets.
			
			
Percentile_Availability.sql :
Contains the code for finding the percentile  availability. With this we can find 90 percentile or median availability ( or any percentile availability).
		Command : call percentile_availability(<NodeISPid>,<startDuration>,<endDuration>,<Percentile>);
		Database: Measurements2
		Arguments : NodeISPid - Id specifying the isp,location combination.( look at the database documentation )
			    startDuration - The date from which Availability is needed
			    endDuration -  The date in epoch till which Availability is needed
			    Percentile - The integer value of what percentile is required. For eg: 50 for median
		Output	: Percentile Availability

AvailabilityRange.ttxt :
The file that is read by FindAvailability.sh to find the availabilities. The file is of the following format : 
	<NodeISPid>	<Location>	<ISP>	<Start_Epoch>	<End_Epoch>
